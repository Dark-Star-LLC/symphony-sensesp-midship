This is for the midship sensesp unit installed in S/V Symphony, part of Dark Star LLC's fleet.

It has these proposed responsibilities:

# SensESP

This project was generated using the template for [SensESP](https://github.com/SignalK/SensESP/) projects. An proof of concept for just the rudder angle sensor can be found at [sensesp-rudder-angle-sensor](https://github.com/mark-brannan/sensesp-rudder-angle-sensor); that example code has been adapted for S/V Symphony's aft sensesp unit.

Comprehensive documentation for SensESP, including how to get started with your own project, is available at the [SensESP documentation site](https://signalk.org/SensESP/).
